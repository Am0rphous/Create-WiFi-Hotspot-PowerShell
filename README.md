# Manage and create  a WiFi Hotspot with PowerShell

This is a script you can use to create a WiFi hotspot in just a couple of seconds.

Download the script 'Manage-and-create-WiFi-HotSpot.ps1' and execute it either by:
- Opening the script in 'PowerShell ISE' and press 'F5'
- Copy and paste the code directly into PowerShell, and press 'enter'

I made a small [wiki](https://github.com/Am0rphous/Create-WiFi-Hotspot-PowerShell/wiki).

Use numbers betweeen 1-10 to execute commands.

The script displays a menu with following options:
